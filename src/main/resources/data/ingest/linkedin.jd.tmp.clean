SUMMARY:The Data Journalist analyzes and shares data for enterprise and investigative reports, as well as revelatory breaking news, for use across the USA Today Network. We’re looking for a data journalist who is an investigative reporter at heart, who loves to find and dig into unique data stories, and has the skill to clean, analyze and develop a wide variety of data sets. Unlike many data-journalist positions, working for the USA TODAY Network’s team requires thinking both nationally and locally and collaborating with local journalists representing more than 100 local newsrooms.

You should be able to think creatively, and fast, about building data sets from inconsistent records across many jurisdictions.  Work with Gannett Digital and the Network’s artists and programmers to develop eye-catching, revelatory digital interactives, with emphasis on the mobile users’ experience.  Work with Network data colleagues to speed development, launch of a data warehouse that would streamline deployment of national, regional and local datasets. The developed system needs to be easy to log into it, search data, download data and obtain related documents and be accommodating for journalists with varying skill levels.  Remain aware of Gannett data and investigative journalism and, where appropriate, help share that work across the USA Today Network. That could include everything from simply flagging a good watchdog story for sharing across the Network to working directly with local journalists to regionalize or nationalize a data-driven story.  Internally and externally, market and elevate USA Today Network’s brand as a high-quality, preeminent source of national and local investigative and data journalism.  Be actively engaged in the daily news, with an eye toward working with journalists across the Network to quickly develop data-driven and watchdog angles from breaking or developing stories.

In a world… where science fiction is constantly making promises that actual science can’t deliver. Where phone booths don’t teleport themselves, and zero calorie beer has yet to exist. One company had the courage to stand up and say, “Hey! Science! Where’s my jetpack?”    Hi. We’re Anki.    When our Co-Founders Boris, Mark and Hanns met in the Ph.D program at Carnegie Mellon’s Robotics Institute, they didn’t dream about artificial intelligence that sends you speeding tickets in the mail, or shrink wraps shrink-wrap. They were united by a shared habit of saying “Hey, wouldn’t it be cool if...?” then actually making that cool thing happen.    Now, we know what you’re thinking: we’re just another all black-wearing, white cat-stroking bunch of weirdos designing laser-powered panini machines in an underground lair somewhere. Nope. Anki is made up of non-crazy people building crazy-cool AI and robotics that are reinventing physical entertainment.    Sound crazy? Maybe. But crazy-in-a-good-way. Maybe that’s why Apple CEO Tim Cook introduced our first product, Anki Drive, in his keynote at WWDC in June 2013. And why top-tier VC’s including Andreessen Horowitz, Index Ventures, and Two Sigma trust us with their money.    Anki is taking years of fancy research and incomprehensible 1’s and 0’s and turning them into exciting things that people actually want. Things they want real bad. Things they didn’t even think could exist.    Imagine impossible interactive experiences. Imagine video games in real life. Imagine jetpacks.    And we’re just getting started.    Excited? Us too. Visit the Anki website and find us on Facebook and YouTube to find out more about Anki - the future of consumer robotics and entertainment.

Arrow offers residential and commercial pest control; termite control; Thermal Acoustical Pest-control (TAP) insulation application; lawn, tree and shrub care; and irrigation in west and central Florida, while our partner companies Bug Out Service in Jacksonville and Skyline Pest Solutions in Atlanta deliver quality service in those areas. We guarantee customer satisfaction to the fullest extent.  The roots of what would become Arrow Environmental Services date back to 1886, when a man named George Pickhardt founded one of the nation's first pest control services near Buffalo, New York. His son, Vern, established Arrow Environmental in Sarasota in 1958, making it one of west Florida's first and longest-established, pest control service companies.  Now under the direction of George's grandson and namesake, company Chairman George Pickhardt, Arrow Environmental Services operates in more than 100 communities in west-central and southwest Florida.  Arrow has been - and continues to be - one of the fastest-growing pest control companies in the nation, as more and more customers join a company built on quality customer service and personal relationships.  We focus on sustainable practices, being especially mindful of the safety of children and pets. Our collaborative style means that we take a wide-ranging approach to addressing your pest control issues.
